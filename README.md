A major issue with traditional, statistical-inference approaches to A/B Testing is that it only compares 2 variables - an experiment/control to an outcome. The problem is that customer behavior is vastly more complex than this. Customers take different paths, spend different amounts of time on the site, come from different backgrounds (age, gender, interests), and more. This is where Machine Learning excels - generating insights from complex systems.
